  |   The Renegade/River City (Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun) series has had     |
  |   its share of success in the late 80's, and now, the "Fight it out"!   |
  |   part of its numerous spin-off sports series is back and powered-up!   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Four players can play at the same time, and the controls are so       |
  |   simple you can actually have your friends and family just hop in      |
  |   and play!                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Online play is supported as well! Come and feel the tension while     |
  |   fighting it out with other players from around the world!             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Do not stick to plain punches and kicks! Armed attacks and throwing   |
  |   techniques are here to spice up an already insane brawl!              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   30 teams, 180 characters and more than 250 different special moves!   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The stages are rigged with various traps, and you get to trigger      |
  |   them!                                                                 |

  |   Discover every team's story in SINGLE PLAY mode, or setup a quick     |
  |   game in FREE PLAY mode. If you get knocked out, a teammate will       |
  |   come and replace you so your team can continue the fight, but only    |
  |   in CHANGE MATCH mode!                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Moreover, there is an ENDLESS BATTLE mode, where you can take on      |
  |   the challenge to defeat the most opponents before your health runs    |
  |   out!                                                                  |

  |   You can also build up your own team! Could it finally be possible     |
  |   to create the dream team no one ever thought of? You can also set     |
  |   the items you want to use during the battle, have some bombs          |
  |   scattered across the stage or no sharp weapons allowed!               |
  |                                                                         |
